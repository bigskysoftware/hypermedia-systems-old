= Client-Side Scripting
:chapter: 10
:url: ./client-side-scripting/

[quote, Roy Fielding, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures]
REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.
This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented.

Thus far we have (mostly) avoided writing any JavaScript (or +_hyperscript+) in Contact.app, mainly because the functionality
we implemented has not required it.  In this chapter we are going to look at scripting and, in particular, hypermedia-friendly
scripting within the context of a Hypermedia-Driven Application.

== Is Scripting Allowed?

A common criticism of the web is that it's being misused.  There is a narrative that WWW was created as a delivery system
for "`documents`", and only came to be used for "`applications`" by way of an accident or bizarre circumstances.

However, the concept of hypermedia challenges the split of document and application, the distinction of code and data, of
operator and operand. Hypermedia systems like HyperCard, which preceded the web, featured rich capabilities for active
and interactive experiences, including scripting.

It is true in many ways that HTML, as specified and implemented, lacks affordances needed to build the kinds of applications
that were implemented within those older systems. None of this means, however, that hypermedia's _purpose_ is "`documents`"
over "`applications.`"

Rather, while the theoretical foundation is there, the implementation is underdeveloped. With JavaScript being the
only extension point and hypermedia controls not being well integrated to JavaScript (why can't one click a link without
halting the program?), developers have not internalized hypermedia and have instead used the Web as a dumb pipe for apps
that imitate "`native`" ones.

A goal of this book is to show that it is possible to build sophisticated web applications using the original technology
of the web, hypermedia, without the application developer needing to reach for the abstractions provided by the large,
popular JavaScript frameworks.

Htmx itself is, of course, written in JavaScript, and one of its advantages is that hypermedia interactions that go
through htmx expose a rich interface to JavaScript code with configuration, events, and htmx's own extension support.

Because htmx expands the expressiveness of HTML so much it removes the need for scripting in many situations.
This makes htmx attractive to people who don't want to write JavaScript, and there are many of those sorts of developers,
wary of the complexity of Single Page Application frameworks.

However, dunking on JavaScript is not the aim of the htmx project.

The goal of htmx is not less JavaScript, per se, but rather less code.

Scripting has been a massive force multiplier for the web. Using scripting, web application developers are not only able
to enhance their HTML websites, but also create full-fledged client-side applications that can often compete with
native, thick client applications.

This JavaScript-centric approach to building web applications is a testament to the power of the web and to the sophistication
of web browsers in particular.  It has its place in web development: there are situations where the hypermedia approach
simply can't provide the level of interaction that an SPA can.

However, in addition to this more JavaScript-centric style, we want to develop a style of scripting more compatible and
consistent with Hypermedia-Driven Applications.


== Scripting for Hypermedia

Borrowing from Roy Fielding's notion of "`constraints`" defining REST, we offer two constraints of hypermedia-friendly
scripting.  You are scripting in an HDA-compatible manner if the following two constraints are adhered to:

* The main data format exchanged between server and client must be hypermedia, the same as it would be without scripting.
* Client-side state, outside the DOM itself, is kept to a minimum.

The goal of these constraints is to confine scripting to where it shines best and where nothing else comes close:
_interaction design_.  Business logic and presentation logic are the responsibility of the server, where we can pick
whichever languages or tools are appropriate for our business domain.

.The Server
[note]
****
Keeping business logic and presentation logic both "`on the server`" does not mean these two "`concerns`" are mixed or
coupled. They can be modularized on the server. In fact, they _should_ be modularized on the server, along with all the
other concerns of our application.

Note also that, especially in web development parlance, the humble "`server`" is usually a whole fleet of racks, virtual
machines, containers and more. Even a worldwide network of datacenters is reduced to "`the server`" when discussing
the server-side of a Hypermedia-Driven Application.
****

Satisfying these two constraints sometimes requires us to diverge from what is typically considered best practice for
JavaScript. Keep in mind that the cultural wisdom of JavaScript was largely developed in JavaScript-centric SPA applications.

The Hypermedia-driven Application cannot as comfortably fall back on this tradition. This chapter is our contribution to the
development of a new style and best practices for what we are calling Hypermedia-Driven Applications.

Unfortunately, simply listing "`best practices`" is rarely convincing or edifying. To be honest, it's boring.

Instead, we will demonstrate these best practices by implementing client-side features in Contact.app.  We will
implement three different features, each showing different aspects of hypermedia-friendly scripting:

* We will add an overflow menu to hold the _Edit_, _View_ and _Delete_ actions, to clean up visual clutter in our list of contacts
* We will add an improved interface for bulk deletion
* We will add a keyboard shortcut for focusing the search box

The important takeaway in the implementation of each of these features is that, while they are implemented entirely in
the client-side using scripting, they _don't exchange information with the server_ via a non-hypermedia format, such
as JSON, and that they don't store a significant amount of state outside of the DOM itself.

== Scripting Tools for the Web

The primary scripting language for the web is, of course, JavaScript, which is ubiquitous in web development today.

A bit of interesting internet lore, however, is that JavaScript was not always the only built-in option.
As the quote from Roy Fielding at the start of this chapter hints, "`applets`" written in other languages such as Java were considered to be
part of the scripting infrastructure of the web. In addition, there was a time period when Internet Explorer supported VBScript,
a scripting language based on Visual Basic.

Today, we have a variety of _transcompilers_ (often shortened to _transpilers_) that convert many languages to JavaScript,
such as TypeScript, Dart, Kotlin, ClojureScript, F# and more. There is also the WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode format, which
is supported as a compilation target for C, Rust, and the WASM-first language AssemblyScript.

However, most of these options are not geared towards a hypermedia-friendly style of scripting. Compile-to-JS languages
are often paired with SPA-oriented libraries (Dart and AngularDart, ClojureScript and Reagent, F# and Elm), and WASM is
currently mainly geared toward linking to C/C++ libraries from JavaScript.

We will instead focus on three client-side scripting technologies that _are_ hypermedia-friendly:

* VanillaJS, that is, using JavaScript without depending on any framework.

* Alpine.js, a JavaScript library for adding behavior directly in HTML.

* +_hyperscript+, a non-JavaScript scripting language created alongside htmx. Like AlpineJS, +_hyperscript+ is usually embedded in HTML.

Let's take a quick look at each of these scripting options, so we know what we are dealing with.

Note that, as with CSS, we are not going to do a deep dive into any of these options.  Instead, we are going to show you
just enough to give you a flavor of how they work and, we hope, spark your interest in looking into any of them more extensively.

== Vanilla JavaScript

[quote,Merb]
No code is faster than no code.

Vanilla JavaScript is simply using plain JavaScript in your application, without any intermediate layers.
The term "`Vanilla`" entered frontend web dev parlance as it became assumed that any sufficiently "`advanced`" web app would
use some library with a name ending in "`.js`". As JavaScript matured as a scripting language, however, standardized across browsers and
provided more and more functionality, these frameworks and libraries became less important.

Somewhat ironically though, as JavaScript became more powerful and removed the need for the first generation of
JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, it also enabled people to build complex SPA libraries.  These SPA libraries are often
even more elaborate than the original first generation of JavaScript libraries.

A quote from the website http://vanilla-js.com, which is well worth visiting even though it's slightly out of date,
captures the situation well:

[quote,http://vanilla-js.com]
VanillaJS is the lowest-overhead, most comprehensive framework I've ever used.

With JavaScript having  matured as a scripting language, this is certainly the case for many applications. It is
especially true in the case of HDAs, since, by using hypermedia, your application will not need many of the features
typically provided by more elaborate Single Page Application JavaScript frameworks:

* Client-side routing
* An abstraction over DOM manipulation, i.e.: templates that automatically update when referenced variables change
* Server side rendering footnote:[Rendering here refers to HTML generation. Framework support for server-side rendering
  is not needed in a HDA because generating HTML on the server is the default.]
* Attaching dynamic behavior to server-rendered tags on load, i.e. "`hydration`"
* Network requests

Without all this complexity being handled in JavaScript, your framework needs are dramatically reduced.

One of the best things about VanillaJS is how you install it: you don't have to!

You can just start writing JavaScript in your web application, and it will simply work.

That's the good news. The bad news is that, despite improvements over the last decade, JavaScript has some significant
limitations as a scripting language that can make it a less than ideal as a stand-alone scripting technology for
Hypermedia-Driven Applications:

* Being as established as it is, it has accreted a lot of features and warts.
* It has a complicated and confusing set of features for working with asynchronous code.
* Working with events is surprisingly difficult.
* DOM APIs (a large portion of which were originally designed for Java, yes _Java_)
  are verbose and don't have a habit of making common functionality easy to use.

None of these limitations are deal-breakers, of course. Many of them are gradually being fixed and many people prefer
the "`close to the metal`" (for lack of a better term) nature of vanilla JavaScript over more elaborate client-side scripting approaches.

=== A Simple Counter

To dive into vanilla JavaScript as a front end scripting option, let's create a simple counter widget.

Counter widgets are a common "`Hello World`" example for JavaScript frameworks, so looking at how it can be done in
vanilla JavaScript (as well as the other options we are going to look at) will be instructive.

Our counter widget will be very simple: it will have a number, shown as text, and a button that increments the number.

One problem with tackling this problem in vanilla JavaScript is that it lacks one thing that most JavaScript frameworks
provide: a default code and architectural style.

With vanilla JavaScript, there are no rules!

This isn't all bad. It presents a great opportunity to take a small journey through various styles that people have
developed for writing their JavaScript.

==== An inline implementation

To begin, let's start with the simplest thing imaginable: all of our JavaScript will be written inline, directly in the
HTML.  When the button is clicked, we will look up the `output` element holding the number, and increment the number
contained within it.

.Counter in vanilla JavaScript, inline version
[source,html]
----
<section class="counter">
  <output id="my-output">0</output> <1>
  <button
    onclick=" <2>
      document.querySelector('#my-output') <3>
        .textContent++ <4>
    "
  >Increment</button>
</section>
----
<1> Our output element has an ID to help us find it.
<2> We use the `onclick` attribute to add an event listener.
<3> Find the output via a querySelector() call.
<4> JavaScript allows us use the `++` operator on strings.

Not too bad.

It's not the most beautiful code, and can be irritating especially if you aren't used to the DOM APIs.

It's a little annoying that we needed to add an `id` to the `output` element. The `document.querySelector()` function
is a bit verbose compared with, say, the `$` function, as provided by jQuery.

But it works. It's also easy enough to understand, and crucially it doesn't require any other JavaScript libraries.

So that's the simple, inline approach with VanillaJS.

==== Separating our scripting out

While the inline implementation is simple in some sense, a more standard way to write this code would be to move the code
into a separate JavaScript file. This JavaScript file would then either be linked to via a `<script src>` tag or
placed into an inline `<script>` tag by a build process.

Here we see the HTML and JavaScript _separated out_ from one another, in different files. The HTML is now "`cleaner`" in
that there is no JavaScript in it.

The JavaScript is a bit more complex than in our inline version: we need to look up the button using a query selector
and add an _event listener_ to handle the click event and increment the counter.

.Counter HTML
[source,html]
----
<section class="counter">
  <output id="my-output">0</output>
  <button class="increment-btn">Increment</button>
</section>
----

.Counter JavaScript
[source,js]
----
const counterOutput = document.querySelector("#my-output") <1>
const incrementBtn  = document.querySelector(".counter .increment-btn") <2>

incrementBtn.addEventListener("click", e => { <3>
  counterOutput.innerHTML++ <4>
})
----
<1> Find the output element
<2> and the button
<3> We use `addEventListener`, which is preferable to `onclick` for many reasons
<4> The logic stays the same, only the structure around it changes

In moving the JavaScript out to another file, we are following a software design principle known as _Separation of Concerns (SoC)._

Separation of Concerns posits that the various "`concerns`" (or aspects) of a software project should be divided up into
multiple files, so that they don't "`pollute`" one another. JavaScript isn't markup, so it shouldn't be in your HTML,
it should be _elsewhere_.  Styling information, similarly, isn't markup, and so it belongs in a separate file as well
(A CSS file, for example.)

For quite some time, this Separation of Concerns was considered the "`orthodox`" way to build web applications.

A stated goal of Separation of Concerns is that we should be able to modify and evolve each concern independently, with
confidence that we won't break any of the other concerns.

However, let's look at exactly how this principle has worked out in our simple counter example.  If you look closely
at the new HTML, it turns out that we've had to add a class to the button.  We added this class so that we could look the button
up in JavaScript and add in an event handler for the "`click`" event.

Now, in both the HTML and the JavaScript, this class name is just a string and there isn't any process to _verify_ that
the button has the right classes on it or its parents to ensure that the event handler is actually added to the right element.

Unfortunately, it has turned out that the careless use of CSS selectors in JavaScript can cause what is known as
_jQuery soup_.  jQuery soup is a situation where:

* The JavaScript that attaches a given behavior to a given element is difficult to find.
* Code reuse is difficult.
* The code ends up wildly disorganized and "`flat`", with lots of unrelated event handlers mixed together.

The name "`jQuery soup`" comes from the fact that most JavaScript-heavy applications used to be built in jQuery (many still are),
which, perhaps inadvertently, tended to encourage this style of JavaScript.

So, you can see that the notion of Separation of Concerns doesn't always work out as well as promised: our concerns
end up intertwined or coupled pretty deeply, even when we separate them into different files.

image::images/diagram/separation-of-concerns.svg["Expectation: HTML concern, CSS concern, JS concern. Reality: HTML Co co co CSS nc nc nc JS ern ern ern"]

To show that it isn't just naming between concerns that can get you into trouble, consider another small change to our HTML
that demonstrates the problems with our separation of concerns: imagine that we decide to change the number field from
an `<output>` tag to an `<input type="number">`.

This small change to our HTML will break our JavaScript, despite the fact we have "`separated`" our concerns.

The fix for this issue is simple enough (we would need to change the `.textContent` property to `.value` property), but
it demonstrates the burden of synchronizing markup changes and code changes across multiple files.  Keeping everything
in sync can become increasingly difficult as your application size increases.

The fact that small changes to our HTML can break our scripting indicates that the two are _tightly coupled_, despite being
broken up into multiple files.  This tight coupling suggests that separation between HTML and JavaScript (and CSS) is often
an illusory separation of concerns: the concerns are sufficiently related to one another that they aren't easily separated.

In Contact.app we are not _concerned_ with "`structure`", "`styling`" or "`behavior`"; we are concerned with collecting contact
info and presenting it to users. SoC, in the way it's formulated in web development orthodoxy, is not really an inviolate
architectural guideline, but rather a stylistic choice that, as we can see, can even become a hindrance.

==== Locality

It turns out that there is a burgeoning reaction _against_ the Separation of Concerns design principle.  Consider the
following web technologies and techniques:

* JSX
* LitHTML
* CSS-in-JS
* Single-File Components
* Filesystem based routing

Each of these technologies _colocate_ code in various languages that address a single _feature_ (typically a UI widget).

All of them mix _implementation_ concerns together in order to present a unified abstraction to the end-user.  Separating
technical detail concerns just isn't as much of an, ahem, concern.

.Locality of Behaviour
****
Locality of Behaviour (LoB) is an alternative software design principle that we coined, in opposition to Separation of Concerns.
It describes the following characteristic of a piece of software:

[quote, https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/]
The behaviour of a unit of code should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code.

In simple terms: you should be able to tell what a button does by simply looking at the code or markup that creates that button.
This does not mean you need to inline the entire implementation, but that you shouldn't need to hunt for it or require prior knowledge of the codebase to find it.

We will demonstrate Locality of Behaviour in all of our examples, both the counter demos and the features we add to Contact.app.
Locality of behavior is an explicit design goal of both +_hyperscript+ and Alpine.js (which we will cover later) as well as htmx.

All of these tools achieve Locality of Behaviour by having you embed attributes directly within your HTML, as opposed to
having code look up elements in a document through CSS selectors in order to add event listeners onto them.
****

In a Hypermedia-Driven Application, we feel that the Locality of Behaviour design principle is often more important than
the more traditional Separation of Concerns design principle.

==== What to do with our counter?

So, should we go back to the `onclick` attribute way of doing things? That approach certainly wins in Locality of
Behavior, and has the additional benefit that it is baked into HTML.

Unfortunately, however, the `on*`  JavaScript attributes also come with some drawbacks:

* They don't support custom events.
* There is no good mechanism for associating long-lasting variables with an element -- all variables are discarded when an event listener completes executing.
* If you have multiple instances of an element, you will need to repeat the listener code on each, or use something more clever like event delegation.
* JavaScript code that directly manipulates the DOM gets verbose, and clutters the markup.
* An element cannot listen for events on another element.

Consider this common situation: you have a popup, and you want it to be dismissed when a user clicks outside of it.  The
listener will need to be on the body element in this situation, far away from the actual popup markup. This means that
the body element would need to have listeners attached to it that deal with many unrelated components.  Some of these
components may not even be on the page when it was first rendered, if they are added dynamically after the initial
HTML page is rendered.

So vanilla JavaScript and Locality of Behaviour don't seem to mesh _quite_ as well as we would like them to.

The situation is not hopeless, however: it's important to understand that LoB does not require behavior to be _implemented_
at a use site, but merely _invoked_ there.  That is, we don't need to write all our code on a given element, we just
need to make it clear that a given element is _invoking_ some code, which can be located elsewhere.

Keeping this in mind, it _is_ possible to improve LoB while writing JavaScript in a separate file, provided we have a
reasonable system for structuring our JavaScript.

=== RSJS

RSJS (the "`Reasonable System for JavaScript Structure`", https://ricostacruz.com/rsjs/) is a set of guidelines for
JavaScript architecture targeted at "`a typical non-SPA website`". RSJS provides a solution to the lack of a standard code
style for vanilla JavaScript that we mentioned earlier.

We won't reproduce all the RSJS guidelines here, but here are the ones most relevant for our counter widget:

* "`Use `data-` attributes`" in HTML - invoking behavior via adding data attributes makes it obvious there is JavaScript
   happening, as opposed to using random classes or IDs that may be mistakenly removed or changed
* "`One component per file`" - the name of the file should match the data attribute so that it can be found easily, a win for LoB

To follow the RSJS guidelines, let's restructure our current HTML and JavaScript files.  First, we will use _data attributes_,
that is, HTML attributes that begin with `data-`, a standard feature of HTML, to indicate that our HTML is a counter
component.  We will then update our JavaScript to use an attribute selector that looks for the `data-counter` attribute
as the root element in our counter component and wires in the appropriate event handlers and logic.  Additionally, let's
rework the code to use `querySelectorAll()` and add the counter functionality to _all_ counter components found on the
page.  (You never know how many counter's you might want!)

Here is what our code looks like now:

.Counter in vanilla JavaScript, with RSJS
--
[source,html]
----
<section class="counter" data-counter> <1>
  <output id="my-output" data-counter-output>0</output> <2>
  <button class="increment-btn" data-counter-increment>Increment</button>
</section>
----
<1> Invoke a JavaScript behavior with a data attribute
<2> Mark relevant descendant elements

[source,js]
----
// counter.js <1>
document.querySelectorAll("[data-counter]") <2>
  .forEach(el => {
    const
    output = el.querySelector("[data-counter-output]"),
    increment = el.querySelector("[data-counter-increment]"); <3>

    increment.addEventListener("click", e => output.textContent++); <4>
  });
----
<1> File should have the same name as the data attribute, so that we can locate it easily
<2> Get all elements that invoke this behavior
<3> Get any child elements we need
<4> Register event handlers
--

Using RSJS solves, or at least alleviates, many of the problems we pointed out with our first, unstructured example of VanillaJS being
split out to a separate file:

* The JS that attaches behavior to a given element is _clear_ (though only through naming conventions).
* Reuse is _easy_ -- you can create another counter component on the page and it will just work.
* The code is _well-organized_ -- one behavior per file.

All in all, RSJS is a good way to structure your vanilla JavaScript in a Hypermedia-Driven Application.  So long as the
JavaScript isn't communicating with a server via a plain data JSON API, or holding a bunch of internal state outside of
the DOM, this is perfectly compatible with the HDA approach.

Let's next take a look at implementing a feature in Contact.app using the RSJS/vanilla JavaScript approach.

=== VanillaJS in Action: An Overflow Menu

Our homepage has "`Edit`", "`View`" and "`Delete`" links for every contact in our table. This uses a lot of space and creates
visual clutter.  Let's fix that by placing these actions inside a drop-down menu with a button to open it.

Let's begin by sketching the markup we want for our dropdown menu.  First, we need an element, we'll use a `<div>`, to enclose the
entire widget and mark it as a menu component.  Within this div, we will have a standard `<button>` that will function
as the mechanism that shows and hides our menu items.  Finally, we'll have another `<div>` that holds the menu items
that we are going to show.

These menu items will be simple anchor tags, as they are in the current contacts table.

Here is what our updated, RSJS-structured HTML looks like:

[source,html]
----
<div data-overflow-menu> <1>
    <button type="button" aria-haspopup="menu"
        aria-controls="contact-menu-{{ contact.id }}"
        >Options</button> <2>
    <div role="menu" hidden id="contact-menu-{{ contact.id }}"> <3>
        <a role="menuitem" href="/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/edit">Edit</a> <4>
        <a role="menuitem" href="/contacts/{{ contact.id }}">View</a>
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
</div>
----
<1> Mark the root element of the menu component
<2> This button will open and close our menu
<3> A container for our menu items
<4> Menu items

The roles and ARIA attributes are based on the Menu and Menu Button patterns from the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide.

.What is ARIA?
****
As we web developers create more interactive, app-like websites, HTML's repertoire of elements won't have all we need.
As we have seen, using CSS and JavaScript, we can endow existing elements with extended behavior and appearances, rivaling
those of native controls.

However, there is one thing web apps used to be unable to replicate. While these widgets are similar enough in appearance
for most users to operate, assistive technology (e.g. screen readers) can only report the underlying HTML elements.

Even if you take the time to get all the keyboard interactions right, some users often are unable to work with these custom
elements easily.

ARIA was created by W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) in 2008 to address this problem.  At a surface level, it is
a set of attributes you can add to HTML to make it meaningful to assistive software such as a screen reader.

ARIA has two main components that interact with one another:

The first is the `role` attribute. This attribute has a predefined set of possible values:

* `menu`
* `dialog`
* `radiogroup`
* etc.

The `role` attribute _does not add any behavior_ to HTML elements. Rather, it is a promise you make to the user.  When
you annotate an element as `role='menu'`, you are saying: _I will make this element work like a menu._

Because this is a promise you are making, if you add the `role` attribute to an element but you _don't_ uphold
the promise, the experience for many users will be _worse_ than if the element had no `role` annotation on it at all.

Because of this, it is written:

[quote, W3C, Read Me First | APG https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/]
No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA.

The second component of ARIA is a whole range of attributes, all sharing the `aria-` prefix:

* `aria-expanded`
* `aria-controls`
* `aria-label`
* etc.

These attributes can specify various things such as the state of a widget, the relationships between components, or
additional semantics.

Once again, these attributes are _promises_, not implementations.

Rather than learn all the roles and attributes and try to combine them into a usable widget,
the best course of action for most developers is to rely on the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG),
a web resource with practical information aimed directly at web developers.

If you're new to ARIA, check out the following links:

 - https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/read-me-first/[ARIA Read Me First]
 - https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/[ARIA UI patterns]
 - https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/[ARIA Good Practices]

Always remember to test your website for accessibility to ensure a maximum number of users can interact with it
easily and effectively.
****

With this ARIA introduction out the way, let's return to our VanillaJS drop down menu.  We'll begin with the RSJS
boilerplate: query for all elements with some data attribute, iterate over them, get any relevant descendants.

Note that, below, we've modified the RSJS boilerplate a bit to integrate with htmx, in particular we load the
overflow menu when htmx loads new content.

[source,js]
----

function overflowMenu(subtree = document) {
  document.querySelectorAll("[data-overflow-menu]").forEach(menuRoot => { <1>
    const
    button = menuRoot.querySelector("[aria-haspopup]"), <2>
    menu = menuRoot.querySelector("[role=menu]"), <2>
    items = [...menu.querySelectorAll("[role=menuitem]")]; <3>
  });
}

addEventListener("htmx:load", e => overflowMenu(e.target)); <4>
----
<1> With RSJS, you'll be writing `document.querySelectorAll(...).forEach` a lot.
<2> To keep the HTML clean, we use ARIA attributes rather than custom data attributes here.
<3> Use the spread operator to convert a `NodeList` into a normal `Array`.
<4> Initialize all overflow menus when the page is loaded or content is inserted by htmx.

Conventionally, we would keep track of whether the menu is open using a JavaScript variable or a property in a JavaScript
state object.  This approach is common in large, JavaScript-heavy web applications.

However, this approach has some drawback:

* We would need to keep the DOM in sync with the state (harder without a framework)
* We would lose the ability to serialize the HTML (as this open state isn't stored in the DOM, but rather in JavaScript).

Instead of taking this approach, we will use the DOM to store our state.  We'll lean on the `hidden` attribute on the
menu element to tell us it's closed. If the HTML of the page is snapshotted and restored, the menu can be restored as
well by simply re-running the JS.

[source,js,highlight=3]
----
  items = [...menu.querySelectorAll("[role=menuitem]")];

  const isOpen = () => !menu.hidden; <1>

});
----
<1> The `hidden` attribute is helpfully reflected as a `hidden` _property_, so we don't need to use `getAttribute`.

We'll also make the menu items non-tabbable, so we can manage their focus ourselves.

[source,js,highlight=3]
----
  const isOpen = () => !menu.hidden; <1>

  items.forEach(item => item.setAttribute("tabindex", "-1"));

});
----

Now let's implement toggling the menu in JavaScript:

[source,js,highlight=3..16]
----
  items.forEach(item => item.setAttribute("tabindex", "-1"));

  function toggleMenu(open = !isOpen()) { <1>
    if (open) {
      menu.hidden = false;
      button.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "true");
      items[0].focus(); <2>
    } else {
      menu.hidden = true;
      button.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "false");
    }
  }

  toggleMenu(isOpen()); <3>
  button.addEventListener("click", () => toggleMenu()); <4>
  menuRoot.addEventListener("blur", e => toggleMenu(false)); <5>

})
----
<1> Optional parameter to specify desired state. This allows us to use one function to open, close, or toggle the menu.
<2> Focus first item of menu when opened.
<3> Call `toggleMenu` with current state, to initialize element attributes.
<4> Toggle menu when button is clicked.
<5> Close menu when focus moves away.

Let's also make the menu close when we click outside it, a nice behavior that mimics how native drop-down menus work. This
will require an event listener on the whole window.

Note that we need to be careful with this kind of listener: you may find that listeners accumulate as components add
listeners and fail to remove them when the component is removed from the DOM.  This, unfortunately, leads to difficult
to track down memory leaks.

There is not an easy way in JavaScript to execute logic when an element is removed.  The best option is what is known
as the `MutationObserver` API.  A `MutationObserver` is very useful, but the API is quite heavy and a bit arcane, so we
won't be using it for our example.

Instead, we will use a simple pattern to avoid leaking event listeners: when our event listener runs, we will check if the
attaching component is still in the DOM, and, if the element is no longer in the DOM, we will remove the listener and
exit.

This is a somewhat hacky, manual form of _garbage collection_.  As is (usually) the case with other garbage collection
algorithms, our strategy removes listeners in a nondeterministic amount of time after they are no longer needed. Fortunately
for us, With a frequent event like "`the user clicks anywhere in the page`" driving the collection, it should work well
enough for our system.

[source,js,highlight=3..6]
----
  menuRoot.addEventListener("blur", e => toggleMenu(false));

  window.addEventListener("click", function clickAway(event) {
    if (!menuRoot.isConnected) window.removeEventListener("click", clickAway); <1>
    if (!menuRoot.contains(event.target)) toggleMenu(false); <2>
  });
});
----
<1> This line is the garbage collection
<2> If the click is outside the menu, close the menu

Now, let's move on to the keyboard interactions for our dropdown menu. The keyboard handlers turn out to all be pretty
similar to one another and not particularly intricate, so let's knock them all out in one go:

[source,js,highlight=4..30]
----
    if (!menuRoot.contains(event.target)) toggleMenu(false); <2>
  });

  const currentIndex = () => { <1>
    const idx = items.indexOf(document.activeElement);
    if (idx === -1) return 0;
    return idx;
  }

  menu.addEventListener("keydown", e => {
    if (e.key === "ArrowUp") {
      items[currentIndex() - 1]?.focus(); <2>

    } else if (e.key === "ArrowDown") {
      items[currentIndex() + 1]?.focus(); <3>

    } else if (e.key === "Space") {
      items[currentIndex()].click(); <4>

    } else if (e.key === "Home") {
      items[0].focus(); <5>

    } else if (e.key === "End") {
      items[items.length - 1].focus(); <6>

    } else if (e.key === "Escape") {
      toggleMenu(false); <7>
      button.focus(); <8>
    }
  });
});
----
<1> Helper: Get the index in the items array of the currently focused menu item (0 if none).
<2> Move focus to the previous menu item when the up arrow key is pressed
<3> Move focus to the next menu item when the down arrow key is pressed
<4> Activate the currently focused element when the space key is pressed
<5> Move focus to the first menu item when Home is pressed
<6> Move focus to the last menu item when End is pressed
<7> Close menu when Escape is pressed
<8> Return focus to menu button when closing menu

That should cover all our bases, and we'll admit that that's a lot of code. But, in fairness, it's code that encodes a
lot of behavior.

Now, our drop-down menu isn't perfect, and it doesn't handle a lot of things.  For example, we don't support submenus,
or menu items being added or removed dynamically to the menu.  If we needed more menu features like this, it might make
more sense to use an off-the-shelf library such as, GitHub's https://github.com/github/details-menu-element[`details-menu-element`].

But, for our relatively simple use case, this library does a fine job, and we got to explore ARIA and RSJS while
implementing it.


== Alpine.js

OK, so that's an in-depth look at how to structure plain VanillaJS-style JavaScript.  Let's turn our attention to an
actual JavaScript framework that enables a different approach for adding dynamic behavior to your application,
https://alpinejs.dev[Alpine.js].

Alpine is a relatively new JavaScript library which allows developers to embed JavaScript code directly in HTML, akin to
the `on*` attributes available in plain HTML and JavaScript.  However, Alpine takes this concept of embedded scripting
much further than `on*` attributes.

Alpine bills itself as a modern replacement for jQuery, the widely used, older JavaScript library.  As you will see, it
definitely lives up to this promise.

Installing Alpine is very easy: it is a single file and is dependency-free, so you can simply include it via a CDN:

.Installing Alpine
[source,html]
----
<script src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs"></script>
----

You can also install it via a package manager such as NPM, or vendor it from your own server.

Alpine provides a set of HTML attributes, all of which begin with the `x-` prefix, the main one of which is `x-data`.
The content of `x-data` is a JavaScript expression which evaluates to an object.  The properties of this object can, then,
be access within the element that the `x-data` attribute is located on.

To get a flavor of what AlpineJS looks like, let's look at how to implement our counter example using it.

For the counter, the only state we need to keep track of is the current number, so let's declare a JavaScript object
with one property, `count`, in an `x-data` attribute on the div for our counter:

.Counter with Alpine, line 1
[source,html]
----
<div class="counter" x-data="{ count: 0 }">
----

This defines our state, that is, the data we are going to be using to drive dynamic updates to the DOM.  With the state
declared like this, we can now use it _within_ the div element it is declared on.  Let's add an `output` element with
an `x-text` attribute.

Next, we will _bind_ the `x-text` attribute to the `count` attribute we declared in the `x-data` attribute
on the parent `div` element.  This will have the effect of setting the text of the `output` element to whatever the
value of `count` is: if `count` is updated, so will the text of the `output`.  This is "`reactive`" programming, in that
the DOM will "`react`" to changes to the backing data.

.Counter with Alpine, lines 1-2
[source,html,highlight=2]
----
<div class="counter" x-data="{ count: 0 }">
  <output x-text="count"></output> <1>
----
<1> The `x-text` attribute.

Next, we need to update the count, using a button.  Alpine allows you to attach event listeners with the `x-on` attribute.

To specify the event to listen for, you add a colon and then the event name after the `x-on` attribute name.  Then, the
value of the attribute is the JavaScript you wish to execute.  This is similar to the plain `on*` attributes we discussed
earlier, but it turns out to be much more flexible.

We want to listen for a `click` event, and we want to increment `count` when a click occurs, so here is what the Alpine
code will look like:

.Counter with Alpine, the full thing
[source,html,highlight=4]
----
<div class="counter" x-data="{ count: 0 }">
  <output x-text="count"></output>

  <button x-on:click="count++">Increment</button> <1>
</div>
----

<1> With `x-on`, we specify the attribute in the attribute _name_.

And that's all it takes.  A simple component like a counter should be simple, and Alpine delivers.

=== "`x-on:click`" vs. "`onclick`"

As we said, the Alpine `x-on:click` attribute (or its shorthand, the `@click` attribute) is similar to the built-in
`onclick` attribute.   However, it has additional features that make it significantly more useful:

* You can listen for events from other elements. For example, the `.outside` modifier lets you listen to any click event
  that is _not_ within the element.
* You can use other modifiers to:
** throttle or debounce event listeners,
** ignore events that are bubbled up from descendant elements, or
** attach passive listeners.
* You can listen to custom events.  For example, if you wanted to listen for the `htmx:after-request` event you could write
  `x-on:htmx:after-request="doSomething()"`

=== Reactivity and Templating

We hope that you'll agree that the AlpineJS version of the counter widget is better, in general, than the VanillaJS
implementation, which was either somewhat hacky or spread out over multiple files.

A big part of the power of AlpineJS is that it supports a notion of "`reactive`" variables, allowing you to bind the count
of the `div` element to a variable that both the `output` and the `button` can reference, and properly updating all the
dependencies when a mutation occurs.  Alpine allows for much more elaborate data bindings than what we have demonstrated
here, and it is an excellent general purpose client-side scripting library.

=== Alpine.js in Action: A Bulk Action Toolbar

Next, let's implement a feature in Contact.app with Alpine. As it stands currently, Contact.app has a "`Delete Selected
Contacts`" button at the very bottom of the page. This button has a long name, is not easy to find and takes up a
lot of room.  If we wanted to add additional "`bulk`" actions, this wouldn't really scale very well visually.

In this section, we'll replace this single button with a toolbar.  Furthermore, the toolbar will only appear when the
user starts selecting contacts. Finally, it will show how many contacts are selected and let you select all contacts in
one go.

The first thing we will need to add is an `x-data` attribute, to hold the state that we will use to determine if the
toolbar is visible or not.  We will need to place this on a parent element of both the toolbar that we are going to
add, as well as the checkboxes, which will be updating the state when they are checked and unchecked.  The best
option given our current HTML is to place the attribute on the `form` element that surrounds the contacts table.  We
will declare a property, `selected`, which will be an array that holds the selected contact ids, based on the checkboxes
that are selected.

Here is what our form tag will look like:

[source,html]
----
<form x-data="{ selected: [] }"> <1>
----
<1> This is the form that was wrapped around the contacts table.

Next, at the top of the contacts table, we are going to add a `template` tag.  A template tag is _not_ rendered by a
browser, by default, so you might be surprised that we are using it.  However, by adding an Alpine `x-if` attribute,
we can tell Alpine: if a condition is true, show the HTML within this template.

Recall that we want to show the toolbar if and only if one or more contacts are selected.  But we know that we will
have the ids of the selected contacts in the `selected` property.  Therefore, we can check the _length_ of that array
to see if there are any selected contacts, quite easily:

// TODO: were we going to have a selected count in the toolbar too?
[source,html]
----
<template x-if="selected.length > 0"> <1>
  <div class="box info tool-bar">
    <slot x-text="selected.length"></slot>
    contacts selected
    
    <button type="button" class="bad bg color border">Delete</button> <2>
    <hr aria-orientation="vertical">
    <button type="button">Cancel</button>
  </div>
</template>
----
<1> Show this HTML if there are 1 or more selected contacts
<2> We will implement these buttons in just a moment

The next step is to ensure that toggling a checkbox for a given contact adds (or removes) a given contact's id from the
`selected` property.  To do this, we will need to use a new Alpine attribute, `x-model`.  The `x-model` attribute allows
you to _bind_ a given element to some underlying data, or its "model".

In this case, we want to bind the value of the checkbox inputs to the `selected` property.  This is how we do this:

[source,html]
----
<td>
<input type="checkbox" name="selected_contact_ids" value="{{ contact.id }}" x-model="selected"> <1>
</td>
----
<1> The `x-model` attribute binds the `value` of this input to the `selected` property

Now, when a checkbox is checked or unchecked, the `selected` array will be updated with the given row's contact id.
Furthermore, mutations we make to the `selected` array will similarly be reflected in the checkboxes' state.  This is
known as a _two-way_ binding.

With this code written, we can make the toolbar appear and disappear, based on whether contact checkboxes are selected.

Very slick.

==== Implementing actions

Now that we have the mechanics of showing and hiding the toolbar, let's look at how to implement the buttons within
the toolbar.

Let's first implement the "`Clear`" button, because it is quite easy.  All we need to do is, when the button is clicked,
clear out the `selected` array.  Because of the two-way binding that Alpine provides, this will uncheck all the selected
contacts (and then hide the toolbar)!

Here is the code:

For the _Cancel_ button, our job is quite simple:
[source,html]
----
<button type="button" @click="selected = []">Cancel</button><1>
----
<1> Just reset the `selected` array

Once again, AlpineJS makes this very easy.

The "`Delete`" button, however, will be a bit more complicated.  It will need to do two things: first it will confirm
if the user indeed intends to delete the contacts selected, and, if the user confirms the action, it will use the
htmx JavaScript API to issue a `DELETE` request.

[source,html]
----
<button type="button" class="bad bg color border"
  @click="confirm(`Delete ${selected.length} contacts?`) && <1>
    htmx.ajax('DELETE', '/contacts', { source: $root, target: document.body })" <2>
>Delete</button>
----
<1> Confirm the user wishes to delete the selected number of contacts
<2> Issue a `DELETE` using the htmx JavaScript API

Note that we are using the short-circuiting behavior of the `&&` operator in JavaScript to avoid the call to
`htmx.ajax()` if the `confirm()` call returns false.

The `htmx.ajax()` function is just a way to access the normal, HTML-driven hypermedia exchange that htmx's
HTML attributes give you directly from JavaScript.

Looking at how we call `htmx.ajax`, we first pass in that we want to issue a `DELETE` to `/contacts`.  We then pass in
two additional pieces of information: `source` and `target`. The `source` property is the element from which htmx will
collect data to include in the request. We set this to `$root`, which is a special symbol in Alpine that will be
the element that has the `x-data` attribute declared on it.  In this case, it will be  the form containing all of our
contacts. The `target`, or where the response HTML will be placed, is just the entire document's body, since the
`DELETE` handler returns a whole page when it completes.

Note that we are using Alpine here in a Hypermedia-Driven Application compatible manner.  We _could_ have issued an
AJAX request directly from Alpine and perhaps updated an `x-data` property depending on the results of that request.
But, instead, we delegated to htmx's JavaScript API, which made a _hypermedia exchange_ with the server.

This is the key to scripting in a hypermedia-friendly manner within a Hypermedia-Driven Application.

So, with all of this in place, we now have a much improved experience for performing bulk actions on contacts:  less
visual clutter and the toolbar can be extended with more options without creating bloat in the main interface of our app.

== _hyperscript

The final scripting technology we are going to look at is a bit further afield:  https://hyperscript.org[+_hyperscript+]. The authors of this book initially created +_hyperscript+ as a sibling project to htmx. We felt that JavaScript wasn't
event-oriented enough, which made adding small scripting enhancements to htmx applications cumbersome. 

While the previous two examples are JavaScript-oriented, +_hyperscript+ has a completely different syntax than JavaScript, based on an older language called HyperTalk.
HyperTalk was the scripting language for a technology called HyperCard, an old hypermedia system available on early
Macintosh Computers.

The most noticeable thing about +_hyperscript+ is that it resembles English prose more than it resembles other programming
languages.  

Like Alpine,
+_hyperscript+ is a modern jQuery replacement. Also like Alpine, +_hyperscript+ allows you to write your scripting inline, in HTML.

Unlike Alpine, however, +_hyperscript+ is _not_ reactive.  It instead focuses on making DOM manipulations in response to events
easy to write and easy to read. It has built-in language constructs for many DOM operations, preventing you from needing
to navigate the sometimes-verbose JavaScript DOM APIs.

We will give a small taste of what scripting in the
+_hyperscript+ language is like, so you can pursue the language in more depth later if you find it interesting.

Like htmx and AlpineJS, +_hyperscript+ can be installed via a CDN or from npm (package name `hyperscript.org`):

.Installing _hyperscript via CDN
[source,html]
----
<script src="//unpkg.com/hyperscript.org"></script>
----

+_hyperscript+ uses the `\_` (underscore) attribute for putting scripting on DOM elements.  You may also use the `script`
or `data-script` attributes, depending on your HTML validation needs.

Let's look at how to implement the simple counter component we have been looking at using +_hyperscript+.  We will place
 an `output` element and a `button` inside of a `div`.  To implement the counter, we will need to add a small bit of
+_hyperscript+ to the button.  On a click, the button should increment the text of the previous `output` tag.

As you'll see, that last sentence is close to the actual +_hyperscript+ code:

[source,html]
----
<div class="counter">
  <output>0</output>
  <button _="on click increment the textContent of the previous <output/>">Increment</button> <1>
</div>
----
<1> The +_hyperscript+ added inline to the button

Let's go through each component of this script:

* `on click` This is an event listener, telling the button to listen for a `click` event and then executing
  the remaining code.

* `increment` This is a "`command`" in +_hyperscript+ that "`increments`" things, similar to the `++` operator in JavaScript.
* the "`the`" doesn't have any semantic meaning +_hyperscript+, but can used to make scripts more readable.
* `textContent of` -  This one form of _property access_ in +_hyperscript+.  You are probably familiar with the JavaScript
   syntax `a.b`, meaning "Get the property `b` on object `a`".  +_hyperscript+ supports this syntax, but _also_ supports
   the forms `b of a` and `a's b`.  Which one you use should depend on which one is most readable.
*  `the previous` The `previous` expression in +_hyperscript+ finds the previous element in the DOM that matches some condition.
*  `<output />` This is a _query literal_, which is a CSS selector wrapped between `<` and `/>`.

In this code, the `previous` keyword (and the accompanying `next` keyword) is an example of how +_hyperscript+ makes DOM operations
easier: there is no such native functionality to be found in the standard DOM API, and implementing this in VanillaJS is trickier
than you might think!

So, you can see, +_hyperscript+ is very expressive, particularly when it comes to DOM manipulations.  This makes it
easier to embed scripts directly in HTML: since the scripting language is more powerful, scripts written in it tend
to be shorter and easier to read.

.Natural Language Programming?
****
Seasoned programmers may be suspicious of +_hyperscript+: There have been many "natural language programming" (NLP)
projects that target non-programmers and beginner programmers, assuming that being able to read code in their
"natural language" will give them the ability to write it as well.  This has lead to some badly written and
structured code and has failed to live up to the (often over the top) hype.

+_hyperscript+ is _not_ an NLP programming language.  Yes, its syntax is inspired in many places
by the speech patterns of web developers. But +_hyperscript+'s readability is achieved not through complex
heuristics or fuzzy NLP processing, but rather through judicious use of common parsing tricks, coupled with a culture
of readability.

As you can see in the above example, with the use of a _query reference_, `<output/>`,  +_hyperscript+ does not shy away
from using DOM-specific, non-natural language when appropriate.
****

=== _hyperscript in Action: A Keyboard Shortcut

// TODO: alt-S instead?  shift-S too aggressive?

While the counter demo is a good way to compare various approaches to scripting, the rubber meets the road when
you try to actually implement a useful feature with an approach.  For +_hyperscript+, let's add a keyboard shortcut
to Contact.app: when a user hits Shift-S in our app, we will focus the search field.

Since our keyboard shortcut focuses the search input, let's put the code for it on that search input, satisfying
locality.

Here is the original HTML for the search input:

[source,html]
----
<input id="search" name="q" type="search" placeholder="Search Contacts">
----

We will add an event listener using the `on keydown` syntax, which will fire whenever a keydown occurs.  Further, we
can use an _event filter_ syntax in +_hyperscript+ using square brackets after the event.  In the square brackets we
can place a _filter expression_ that will filter out `keydown` events we aren't interested in.  In our case, we only
want to consider events where the shift key is held down and where the "`S`" key is being pressed.  We can create a
boolean expression that inspects the `shiftKey` property (to see if it is `true`) and the `code` property (to see if
it is `"KeyS"`) of the event to achieve this.

So far our +_hyperscript+ looks like this:

.A start on our keyboard shortcut
[source, hyperscript]
----
  on keydown[shiftKey and code is 'KeyS'] ...
----

Now, by default, +_hyperscript+ will listen for a given event _on the element it is declared on_.  So, in this case, with
the script we have so far, we would only get `keydown` events if the search box is already focused.  That's not what
we want!  We want to have this key work _globally_, no matter which element has focus.

Not a problem!  We can listen for the `keyDown` event elsewhere by using a `from` clause in our event handler.  In this
case we want to listen for the `keyDown` from the window, and our code ends up looking, naturally, like this:

.Listening globally
[source, hyperscript]
----
  on keydown[shiftKey and code is 'KeyS'] from window ...
----

Using the `from` clause, we can attach the listener to the window while, at the same time, keeping the code on the
element it logically relates to.

Now that we've picked out the event we want to use to focus the search box, let's implement the actual focusing by
calling the standard `.focus()` method.

Here is the entire script, embedded in HTML:

.Our final script
[source,html]
----
<input id="search" name="q" type="search" placeholder="Search Contacts"
  _="on keydown[shiftKey and code is 'KeyS'] from the window
       me.focus()"> <1>
----
<1> "`me`" refers to the element that the script is written on.

Given all the functionality, this is surprisingly terse, and, as an English-like programming language, pretty easy to
read.

=== Why a New Programming Language?

This is all well and good, but you may be thinking "`An entirely new scripting language?  That seems excessive.`"  And,
at some level, you are right: JavaScript is a decent scripting language, is very well optimized and is widely understood
in web development.  On the other hand, by creating an entirely new front end scripting language, we had the freedom
to address some problems that we saw generating ugly and verbose code in JavaScript:

Async transparency:: In +_hyperscript+, asynchronous functions (i.e. functions that return `Promise` instances) can be
invoked _as if they were synchronous_. Changing a function from sync to async does not break any +_hyperscript+ code that
calls it.  This is achieved by checking for a Promise when evaluating any expression, and suspending the running script
if one exists (only the current event handler is suspended and the main thread is not blocked). JavaScript, instead, requires
either the explicit use of callbacks _or_ the use of explicit `async` annotations (which can't be mixed with synchronous
code).

Array property access:: In +_hyperscript+, accessing a property on an array (other than `length` or a number) will return
an array of the values of property on each member of that array, making array property access act like a flat-map operation.
jQuery has a similar feature, but only for its own data structure.

Native CSS Syntax:: In +_hyperscript+, you can use things like CSS class and ID literals, or CSS query literals, directly
in the language, rather than needing to call out to a wordy DOM API, as you do in JavaScript.

Deep Event Support:: Working with events in +_hyperscript+ is far more pleasant than working with them in JavaScript, with
native support for responding to and sending events, as well as for common event-handling patterns such as "`debouncing`"
or rate limiting events.  +_hyperscript+ also provides declarative mechanisms for synchronizing events within a given element
and across multiple elements.

Again we wish to stress that, in this example, we are not stepping outside the lines of a Hypermedia-Driven
Application: we are only adding front-end, client-side functionality with our scripting.  We are not creating and
managing a large amount of state outside of the DOM itself, or communicating with the server in a non-hypermedia
exchange.

Additionally, since +_hyperscript+ embeds so well in HTML, it keeps the focus _on the hypermedia_, rather than on the
scripting logic.

Taken all together, given a certain style of scripting and certain scripting needs, +_hyperscript+ can provide an
excellent scripting experience for your Hypermedia-Driven Application.  It is a small and obscure programming
language, so we won't blame you if you decide to pass on it, but it is worth a look to understand what it
is trying to achieve.

== Using Off-the-Shelf Components

That concludes our look at three different options for _your_ scripting infrastructure, that is, the code that _you_ write
to enhance your Hypermedia-Driven Application.  However, there is another major area to consider when discussing client
side scripting: "`off the shelf`" components.  That is, JavaScript libraries that other people have created that offer
some sort of functionality, such as showing modal dialogs.

Components have become very popular in the web development works, with libraries like  https://datatables.net/[DataTables]
providing rich user experiences with very little JavaScript code on the part of a user.  Unfortunately, if these libraries
aren't integrated well into a website, they can begin to make an application feel "`patched together`".  Furthermore, some
libraries go beyond simple DOM manipulation, and require that you integrate with a server endpoint, almost invariably
with a JSON data API.  This means you are no longer building a Hypermedia-Driven Application, simply because a particular
widget demands something different.  A shame!

=== Integration Options

The best JavaScript libraries to work with when you are building a Hypermedia-Driven Application are ones that:

* Mutate the DOM but don't communicate with a server over JSON
* Respect HTML norms (e.g. using `input` elements to store values)
* Trigger many custom events, as the library updates things

The last point, triggering many custom events (over the alternative of using lots of methods and callbacks) is especially
important, as these custom events can be dispatched or listened to without additional glue code written in a scripting language.

Let's take a look at two different approaches to scripting, one using JavaScript call backs, and one using events.

To make things concrete, let's  implement a better confirmation dialog for the `DELETE` button we created in Alpine in the
previous section.  In the original example we used the `confirm()` function built in to JavaScript, which shows a
pretty bare-bones system confirmation dialog.  We will replace this function with a popular JavaScript library,
SweetAlert2, that shows a much nicer looking confirmation dialog.  Unlink the `confirm()` function, which blocks
and returns a boolean (`true` if the user confirmed, `false` otherwise), SweetAlert2 returns a `Promise` object, which
is a JavaScript mechanism for hooking in a callback once an asynchronous action (such as waiting for a user to confirm
or deny an action) completes.

==== Integrating using callbacks

With SweetAlert2 installed as a library, you have access to the `Swal` object, which has a `fire()` function on it to
trigger showing an alert.  You can pass in arguments to the `fire()` method to configure exactly what the buttons
on the confirmation dialog look like, what the title of the dialog is, and so forth.  We won't get into these details
too much, but you will see what a dialog looks like in a bit.

So, given we have installed the SweetAlert2 library, we can swap it in place of the `confirm()` function call.  We then
need to restructure the code to pass a _callback_ to the `then()` method on the `Promise` that `Swal.fire()` returns.  A
deep dive into Promises is beyond the scope of this chapter, but suffice to say that this callback will be called when
a user confirms or denies the action.  If the user confirmed the action, then the `result.isConfirmed` property will be
`true`.

Given all that, our updated code will look like this:

.A callback-based confirmation dialog
[source,html]
----
<button type="button" class="bad bg color border"
  @click="Swal.fire({  <1>
                  title: 'Delete these contacts?',  <2>
                  showCancelButton: true,
                  confirmButtonText: 'Delete'
                }).then((result) => { <3>
                  if (result.isConfirmed) {
                    htmx.ajax('DELETE', '/contacts', { source: $root, target: document.body })
                  }
               });"
>Delete</button>
----
<1> Invoke the `Swal.fire()` function
<2> Configure how the dialog appears
<3> Handle the result of the users selection

And now, when this button is clicked, we get a nice looking dialog in our web application:

image::screenshot_sweet_alert.png[Modal dialog: "Delete these contacts?" with a colorful delete button and gray cancel button.]

Much nicer than the system confirmation dialog.  Still, this feels a little wrong.  This is a lot of code to write
just to trigger a slightly nicer `confirm()`, isn't it?  And the htmx JavaScript code we are using here feels
awkward.  It would be more natural to move the htmx out to attributes on the button, as we have been doing, and then
trigger the request via events.

So let's take a different approach and see how that looks.

==== Integrating using events

To clean this code up, we will pull the `Swal.fire()` code out to a custom JavaScript function we will create called
`sweetConfirm()`.  `sweetConfirm()` will take the dialog options that are passed into the `fire()` method, as well as
the element that is confirming an action.  The big difference between the code we already have and `sweetConfirm()` is
that `sweetConfirm()`, rather than calling some htmx directly, will, instead, trigger a `confirmed` event on the
button when the user confirms they wish to delete.

Here is what our JavaScript function looks like:

.An event-based confirmation dialog
[source,javascript]
----
function sweetConfirm(elt, config) {
      Swal.fire(config) <1>
          .then((result) => {
                  if (result.isConfirmed) {
                      elt.dispatchEvent(new Event('confirmed')); <2>
                  }
          });
}
----
<1> Pass the config through to the `fire()` function.
<2> If the user confirmed the action, trigger a `confirmed` event.

With this method available, we can now tighten up our delete button quite a bit.  We can remove all the SweetAlert2
code that we had in the `@click` Alpine attribute, and simply call this new `sweetConfirm()` method, passing in the
arguments `$el`, which is the Alpine syntax for getting `"the current element`" that the script is on, and then
the exact configuration we want for our dialog.

If the user confirms the action, a `confirmed` event will be triggered on the button.  This means that we can go back
to using our trusty htmx attributes!  Namely, we can move `DELETE` to an `hx-delete` attribute, and we can we can use
`hx-target` to target the body.  And then, and here is the crucial step, we can use the `confirmed` event that is
triggered in the `sweetConfirm()` function, to trigger the request, but adding an `hx-trigger` for it.

Here is what our code looks like:

.An Event-based Confirmation Dialog
[source,html]
----
<button type="button" class="bad bg color border"
        hx-delete="/contacts" hx-target="body" hx-trigger="confirmed" <1>
        @click="sweetConfirm($el, <2>
                { title: 'Delete these contacts?',  <3>
                  showCancelButton: true,
                  confirmButtonText: 'Delete'})">
----
<1> htmx attributes are back.
<2> We pass the button in to the function, so an event can be triggered on it.
<3> We pass through the SweetAlert2 configuration information.

As you can see, this event-based code is much cleaner and certainly more "`HTML-ish`".  The key to this cleaner
implementation is that our new `sweetConfirm()` function fires an event that htmx is able to listen for.

This is why a rich event model is important to look for when choosing a library to work with, both with htmx and with
Hypermedia-Driven Applications in general.

Unfortunately, due to the prevalence and dominance of the JavaScript-first mindset today, many libraries are like
SweetAlert2: they expect you to pass a callback in the first style.  In these cases you can use the technique we
have demonstrated here, wrapping the library in a function that triggers events in a callback, to make the library more
hypermedia and htmx-friendly.

== Pragmatic Scripting

We have shown you quite a few tools and techniques for scripting in a Hypermedia-Driven Application.  How should you
pick between them?  The sad truth is that there will never be a single, always correct answer to this question.

Are you committed to vanilla JavaScript-only, perhaps due to company policy?  Well, you can use vanilla JavaScript effectively
to script your Hypermedia-Driven Application.

Do you have more leeway and like the look of Alpine.js?  That's a great way to add more structured, localized JavaScript
to your application, and offers some nice reactive features as well.

Are you a bit more bold in your technical choices?  Maybe +_hyperscript+ would be worth taking a look at.  (We certainly think so.)

Sometimes you might even consider picking two (or more) of these approaches within an application.  Each has its own
strengths and weaknesses, and all of them are relatively small and self-contained, so picking the right tool for the job
at hand might be the best approach.

In general, we encourage a _pragmatic_ approach to scripting: whatever feels right is probably right (or, at least,
right _enough_) for you.  Rather than being concerned about which particular approach is taken for your scripting,
we would focus on these more general concerns:

* Avoid communicating with the server via JSON data APIs
* Avoid storing large amounts of state outside of the DOM
* Favor using events, rather than hard-coded callbacks or method calls

And even on these topics, sometimes a web developer has to do what a web developer has to do.  If the perfect widget
for your application exists but uses a JSON data API?  That's OK.

Just don't make it a habit.
