== Hypermedia Reconsidered

We hope to have convinced you that hypermedia, rather than being a "`legacy`" technology
or a technology only appropriate for "`documents`" of links, text and pictures, is, in fact, a powerful technology for
building _applications_.  In this book you have seen how to build sophisticated user interfaces -- for both the web, with htmx,
and for mobile applications, using Hyperview -- using hypermedia as a core underlying application technology.

Many web developers view the links and forms of "`plain`" HTML as bygone tools
from a less sophisticated age.  And, in some ways, they are right: there were definite usability issues with the
original web. However, there are now JavaScript libraries that extend HTML by addressing its core limitations.

Htmx, for example, allowed us to:

* Make any element capable of issuing an HTTP request
* Make any event capable of triggering an HTTP event
* Use all the available types of HTTP methods
* Target any element in the DOM for replacement

With that, we were able to build user interfaces for Contact.app that many developers would assume require a significant amount of client-side
JavaScript, and we did it using hypermedia concepts.

The Hypermedia-Driven Application approach is not right for every application. For many applications, though, the increased flexibility and simplicity of hypermedia can be a huge
benefit.  Even if your application wouldn't benefit from this approach, it is worthwhile to _understand_
the approach, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it differs from the approach you are taking.  The original web
grew faster than any distributed system in history; web developers should know how to tap the power of the underlying technologies that
made that growth possible.

== Pausing, and Reflecting

The JavaScript community and, by extension, the web development community is famously chaotic, with new frameworks and
technologies emerging monthly, and sometimes even _weekly_.  It can be exhausting to keep up with the latest and
greatest technologies, and, at the same time, terrifying that we _won't_ keep up with them and
be left behind in our career.

This is not a fear without foundation: there are many senior software engineers that have seen their careers peter out
because they picked a technology to specialize in that, fairly or not, did not thrive.  The web development world tends
to be young, with many companies favoring young developers over older developers who "`haven't kept up.`"

We shouldn't sugar-coat these realities of our industry.  On the other hand, we also shouldn't ignore the downside that
these realities create.  It creates a high-pressure environment where everyone is watching for "`the new new`" thing, that
is, for the latest and greatest technology that is going to change everything.  It creates pressure to _claim_ that your
technology is going to change everything.  It tends to favor _sophistication_ over
_simplicity_.  People are scared to ask "`Is this too complex?`" because it sounds an awful lot like "`I'm not smart enough
to understand this.`"

The software industry tends, especially in web development, to lean far more towards innovating, rather than
understanding existing technologies and building on them or within them.  We tend to look ahead for new, genius
solutions, rather than looking to established ideas.  This is understandable: the technology world is necessarily
a forward-looking industry.

On the other hand -- as we saw with Roy Fielding's formulation of REST -- some early architects of the web had some great ideas which have been overlooked. We are old enough
to have seen hypermedia come and go as the "`new new`" idea. It was a little shocking to us to see powerful ideas like
REST discarded so cavalierly by the industry. Fortunately, the concepts are still sitting there, waiting to be rediscovered
and reinvigorated.  The original, RESTful architecture of the web, when looked at with fresh eyes, can address many of
the problems that today's web developers are facing.

Perhaps, following Mark Twain's advice, it is time to pause and reflect.  Perhaps, for a few quiet moments, we can
put the endless swirl of the "`new new`" aside, look back on where the web came from, and learn.

Perhaps it's time to give hypermedia a chance.

.HTML Notes: Toward Effective HTML
****
Throughout the book we discuss a number of best practices for writing effective HTML. They are, in a nutshell: 

* Stay close to the HTML markup you’re producing and be able to change it. Prefer frameworks and components that help you do this.
* Apply the Locality of Behavior principle to HTML.
* Familiarize yourself with the full range of available tags and attributes and make them part of your toolkit. Don't restrict yourself to what Markdown can do.
// we should be able to say the s word by now
* Aim for good fit between tag semantics and your use case; make frequent use of the HTML specs. 
* When more specific tags don't fit, it is usually better to step back to <div> than to use a tag incorrectly. 
* Stick with established libraries for UI interactions. If a use case requires an improvised solution, test carefully for keyboard and touch interaction and accessibility.
* Prefer components that extend HTML, rather than abstracting it away.
* To the extent possible, test your HTML with screenreaders, with a keyboard, with different browsers and hardware, and run linters (while coding and/or in CI).
